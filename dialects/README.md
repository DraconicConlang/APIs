# NEW DIALECT SUBMISSIONS ARE PAUSED UNTIL REGULAR DRACONIC IS FULLY STANDARDIZED
# NOTICE
If you decide to include your dialect in here, you should comply with these rules:
- **Licensing**: The Draconic Language is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), so you need to license your dialect the same and state original author.
- **Stay consistent**: Some developers may not want to struggle to integrate your dialect into their projects. Avoid changing names or structures arbitrarily, unless Regular ones are changed. In other words - stick to Regular Draconic's structure.
- **Deprecate properly**: If you remove or replace functions or mappings, mark them as deprecated in the original JS and include them in Deprecated.js to maintain compatibility. You may leave them as-is without updates. If they cannot work under any circumstances, you may delete them.
- **Work in branches**: Make all changes in separate branches rather than directly in the main one. When you are done updating and testing everything, you may create a pull request.
- **Respect other's boundaries**: Do not edit other's dialects in any way. Regular Draconic is maintained by LiroxDeYamon, _eXeCutie and SuPDuZz.
#### Happy codding!
